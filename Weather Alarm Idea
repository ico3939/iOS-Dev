	⁃	cloudy
	⁃	hot/cold (over/under a certain temperature)
	⁃	windy
	⁃	plays the piece of music based on the current weather
	⁃	potential for multiple pieces of music for a given condition
	⁃	If number of pieces > 1; the piece is randomly chosen
	⁃	has a library of default public domain themes
	⁃	Otherwise, the user can choose the music from a certain folder
	⁃	different visuals based on the current weather
	⁃	User can also use different pieces between a full night’s rest and just taking a nap
	⁃	Dark Sky API for weather data
	⁃	Forecast for the next 24 hours
	⁃	Can choose to wake up at sunrise
	⁃	If the weather is inclement (snowy/heavy rain) you can choose to wake up earlier
	⁃	takes current location
